# My Design Philosophy

When building software, I think it is important to have a solid design philosphy. Here are the principles I'll try my best to adhere:

## 1- Simple & Elegant 

- I think many software and applications are unnecessarily complex. I'm designing my software to be as straightforward and lightweight as possible.
- Firt, the program should be encapsulated to a well defined entity "Google Play Application, PIP package, Docker container...) Oftentimes complexity starts here due to vague definition of the program
- The program should be installable with a single click or command when possible.
- Usage of the program should be easy and clear. Customization should be optional without causing overhead to the general userbase.

## 2- Quality over Quantity

I'll be sharing high quality softwares, not 1st year "Hello World" assignments to increase my repository count. I think a program should achieve at least one of the following.

- Provide a brand new feature
- Improve existing features or make them more accesible/ easier to use
- Provide quality of life improvements for software or hardware
- Be useful for a new discovery in science, engineering or arts
- Have value for educational or hobyy purposes.

Otherwise it is a junk. And like Steve Jobs said, I don't ship junk.



## 3- Good Documentation

I always ensure my software has crystal clear documentation on how to install and use it. In my Python and Java libraries, I pay attention to my module display documentation when hovered over by mouse on most IDEs

## 4- Efficent & Lightweight
It is important to make the problem as optimized as possible, especially on mobile platforms. So I'm striving to:

- Avoid unnecessary imports, packages or low-effort abstraction tools.
- Use efficent algorithms and data structures. Theorotical math and computer science concepts become very vital here.
- Use low level programming languages like ARM Assembly to squzee every single clock cycle.
- Pay attention to overlooked details such as Multithreading vs Multiprocessing in Python.
- Test the program under various enviroments and conditions to optimize for the broadest use cases


## 5- Transparent

All of my software is fully transparent about what they do, I won't ever engage in shady practices.
My Android app Easy Stock Data doesn't require any permissions, never works in background and never sends any data to me.
Currently all of my software is my free, If I release a paid content in future everything about it will be clearly explained.



## 6- Open to Feedback

I'm open to any kind of feedback about all of my content. 

- Bug Fixes
- New Feature Suggestions
- Criticisms
- Improving documentation
- New Software Ideas

  I'll announce a program that people giving me helpful feedback(i.e. a feature suggestions that's been implemented) will earn a discount coupon to be usable in any of my software. Currently all of my software is free but that 20% discount coupon can become handy when I'm releasing my million dollar hit :)
