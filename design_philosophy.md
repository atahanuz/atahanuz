# My Design Philosophy

When developing software, I believe it's crucial to maintain a solid design philosophy. Here are the principles I'll try my best to adhere:

## 1- Simple & Elegant 

- I think many software and applications are unnecessarily complex. I'm designing my software to be as straightforward and lightweight as possible.
- Firt of all, the program should be encapsulated to a well defined entity "Google Play Application, PIP package, Docker container...) Oftentimes complexity starts here due to vague definition of the program
- The program should be installable with a single click or command when possible.
- Usage of the program should be easy and clear. Customization should be optional without causing overhead to the general userbase.

### Examples

<table>
<tr>
<td>

```python
import yt2text

text = yt2text.get_text("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLeJJPxua3E")
print(text)
```

</td>
<td>

Usage of my y2text Python library. While there are many apps to extract text from a Youtube video, I believe mine is by far the simpliest.

</tr>

    </td>
    <td>
      My Android app <a href="https://github.com/atahanuz/easy_stock_data">Easy Stock Data</a> displays extensive information about a stock <br> simply by entering the ticker and pressing a button
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>










## 2- Quality over Quantity

I'll be sharing high quality softwares, not 1st year "Hello World" assignments to increase my repository count. I think a program should achieve at least one of the following.

- Provide a brand new feature
- Improve existing features or make them more accesible/ easier to use
- Provide quality of life improvements for developers or users
- Be useful for a new discovery in science, engineering or arts
- Have value for educational or hobyy purposes.

Otherwise it is a junk. And like Steve Jobs said, I don't ship junk.



## 3- Good Documentation

I always ensure my software has crystal clear documentation on how to install and use it. In my Python and Java libraries, I pay attention to my module display documentation when hovered over by mouse on most IDEs

## 4- Efficent & Lightweight
It is important to make the program as optimized as possible, especially on mobile platforms. So I'm striving to:

- Avoid unnecessary imports, packages or low-effort abstraction tools.
- Use efficent algorithms and data structures. Theoretical mathematics and computer science concepts are very vital here.
- Use low level programming languages like ARM Assembly to squzee every single clock cycle.
- Pay attention to overlooked details such as Multithreading vs Multiprocessing in Python.
- Test the program under various enviroments and conditions to optimize for the broadest use cases

    </td>
    <td>
     My Android app's size was initially 70 MB, I was able to optimize it down to 5.88 MB
    </td>
  </tr>

## 5- Transparent

All of my software is fully transparent about what they do, I won't ever engage in shady practices.<br>
My Android app Easy Stock Data doesn't require any permissions, never works in background and never sends any data to me. <br>
Currently all of my software is my free, If I release a paid content in the future everything about it will be clearly communicated.


## 6- Open to Feedback

I'm open to any kind of feedback about all of my content. 

- Bug Fixes
- Feature Suggestions
- Criticisms
- Improving documentation
- New Software Ideas

I'll announce a campaign that people giving me helpful feedback(i.e. a feature suggestion that's been implemented) will earn a discount coupon to be usable in any of my software. Currently all of my software is free but that 20% discount coupon can become handy when I'm releasing my million dollar hit :)


## Contact
You can mail me at atahanuz23@gmail.com at anytime for anything. I usually respond on the same day.
<br>
If it is about one of my repos, it'd be better if you raise an Issue in the repo so everyone can see and contribute to the discussion.
