## Hello

Hi, I am Atahan Uz. I'm studying Computer Engineering in Yildiz Technical University

My first Google Play app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atahanuz.easy_stock_data


I'm planning to share some hobby projects. My publications on Github:
- Will provide an utility and/ or be fun.
- Will be easy to use. I believe many programs on GitHub are unnecessarily complex. If everything can be achieved in a single Python file, you shouldn't ask the user to run 999 terminal commands. Wherever possible, I'll provide a single file that can be run directly and I'll provide all necessary instructions to run the program.
- Will be clear and modest about what it can/can't do. I won't make extravagant claims.


## Contact
