## Hello

Hi, I am Atahan Uz. I'm studying Computer Engineering in Yildiz Technical University

Alongside my school projects, I'm planning to share some hobby projects. I believe that publications on Github:
- Should provide an utility and/or be fun.
- Should be easy to use. I believe many programs on GitHub are unnecessarily complex. If everything can be achieved in a single Python file, you shouldn't ask the user to run 999 terminal commands. Wherever possible, I'll provide a single file that can be run directly and I'll provide all necessary instructions to run the program.
- Should be clear and modest about what they can/can't do. I won't claim that my program changes the world when all it does is printing "Hello World" ðŸ˜€.
