## Hello

Hi, I am Atahan Uz. I'm studying Computer Engineering in Yildiz Technical University

Alongside my school projects, I'm planning to share some hobby projects. I believe that publications on Github:
-Should provide utility and/or be fun.
-Should be easy to use. I believe many programs on GitHub are unnecessarily complex to install. Wherever possible, I'll provide a single file that can be run directly and I'll provide all necessary instructions to run the program.
-Should be clear and modest about what they can/can't do. I won't claim that my program changes the world when all it does is printing Hello World ðŸ˜€
